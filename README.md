 # SNAKE/WATER/GUNgame
Hey folks welcome all, this is my first project with reference to WEB DEVELOPMENT.The main aim of this project is to understand the workflow of "Math" which is a built-in object in JavaScript.
Through this project you will get to know how the in-built "Math function" is used and implemented. Overthis project i just used only two "Math Function"- math.floor and math.random.
Coming to the main scenario of the project as the name suggest we are basically playing game with our cpu,we are giving prompt as S,W,G which indicate snake, water and gun.And with response our cpu takes action and give response as S,W and G.After this our program evaluate whether CPU WINS or Users Wins.This how our games go's:
1>if cpu === user No body wins. Match is tied.
2>if cpu === "S" && user === "W" CPU Wins.
3>if cpu === "S" && user === "G" - Users Wins.
4>if cpu === "G" && user === "W" - Users Wins.
5>if cpu === "G" && user === "S" - CPU Wins.
6>if cpu === "W" && user === "S" -Users Wins.
7>if cpu === "W" && user === "G" - CPU Wins.
In last the program result whether CPU Wins or Users.
